Demo example of using OpenAI Codex to program robots

This is a complete block of code that was otput from the OpenAI Codex API. It took a bit of twigging to make it work, but in all OpenAI Codex can also program robots.

You would need to install ROS and Moveit package in order to be able to run the code.

OpenAI Codex seem like a very powerful tool that can help us to program robots more faster.
