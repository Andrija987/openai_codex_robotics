# OpenAI Codex for robotics

Demo example of using OpenAI Codex to program robots.

This is a complete block of code that was output from the OpenAI Codex API. It took a bit of twigging to make it work, but in all OpenAI Codex can also program robots.

see the video about this here:

You would need to install [ROS](https://www.ros.org/) and Moveit package in order to be able to run the code.

OpenAI Codex seem like a very powerful tool that can help us to program robots more faster.
